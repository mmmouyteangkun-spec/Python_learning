# while loop = execute some code WHILE some condition remains true

# Example 1
#name = input("Enter your name: ")

# while name == "":
#   print("You did not enter your name")
#    name = input("Enter your name: ")
#    print(f"Hello {name}")

# Example 2
# age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

#while age < 0:
#    print("Age can't be negative")
#    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
#print(f"You are {age} years old")

# Example 3
# food = input("Enter a food you like (q to quit): ")

# while not food == "q":
#   print(f"You like {food}")
#   food = input("Enter another food you like (q to quit): ")

# print("bye")

# Example 4
num = int(input("Enter a # between 1 - 10: "))

while num < 1 or num > 10:
    print(f"{num} is not valid")
    num = int(input("Enter a # between 1 - 10: "))

print(f"Your number is {num}")
